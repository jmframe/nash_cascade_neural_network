# Nash Cascade Neural Network (NCNN) Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the Nash Cascade Neural Network (NCNN), a hydrologic conceptual model designed for deep learning-based differentiable parameter learning. It aims to represent hydrologic systems intuitively and is inspired by the synchronization of hydrologic processes in modeling using concepts, physics, and neural networks.

## Environment Setup
To set up the environment for running the NCNN project, use the provided `environment_cpu.yml` file. This file contains all the necessary dependencies. To create the environment, run the following command:

`conda env create -f environment_cpu.yml`

## Running the Code
The main code for the NCNN project is located in ncn.py. To run the project, launch the Jupyter notebook `nash_cascade_neural_network.ipynb`
